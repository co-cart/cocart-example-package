# CoCart Example Package

This is an example feature plugin package for CoCart Pro. It is setup so that it can be installed standalone as a WordPress plugin, or included into CoCart Pro as a Composer Package.

## Installing Composer

You need Composer to use the packages. If you don't have it installed, go and check how to **install Composer** and then continue here.

## Installing packages

Once you have defined your package requirements, run

```
composer install
```

and that will install the required Composer packages.
